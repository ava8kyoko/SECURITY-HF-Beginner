## Challenge 
SQL injection is probably one of the most common vectors of attack for poorly designed websites.
<a href="https://beginnersqli.hfctf.ca/">This page</a> is vulnerable to it. You can use username 
test and password test if you want to test the page before the injection.

## Steps
1. Username : `root'-- ` don't forget the space
2. Password : let-it blank
